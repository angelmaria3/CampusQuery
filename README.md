# CampusQuery – AI Powered College Helpdesk Chatbot

## 📌 Overview

CampusQuery is an AI-powered college helpdesk chatbot designed to provide students with instant, accurate, and college-specific information. It centralizes commonly scattered information such as attendance rules, exam registration details, fee deadlines, department information, events, and condonation procedures into a single conversational interface.

The system uses a rule-based knowledge layer combined with AI (Gemini) to generate clear, human-like responses. Supabase Edge Functions are used to securely connect the frontend with the database and AI services.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd campusquery
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
bun install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

```env

### 4. Supabase Edge Function Setup

In Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to **Edge Functions**
2. Create a function named: `rapid-processor`
3. Add the provided `index.ts` code
4. Add secrets in **Edge Functions → Secrets**:

   * `SUPABASE_URL`
   * `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   * `GEMINI_API_KEY`
5. Click **Deploy**

---

### 5. Run the Project

```bash
npm run dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open in browser:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## 🔁 How It Works (Flow)

1. User enters a question in the chat UI
2. Frontend calls:

   ```ts
   supabase.functions.invoke('rapid-processor', { body: { query } })
   ```
3. Edge Function:

   * Parses the query
   * Fetches relevant data from Supabase tables
   * Sends formatted data to Gemini API
   * Returns AI response
4. Frontend displays the response

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

* Publishable key is used only in frontend
* Service role key is stored securely in Edge Function secrets
* RLS can be enabled for additional safety

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Admin panel for managing rules and events
* Multi-language support
* Student authentication
* Notification system
* Voice input
